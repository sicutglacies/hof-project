        "abstract": "Drug repurposing (DR), also known as drug repositioning, is a method that identifies novel therapeutic uses from existing drugs. This strategy is highly effective, saves time, cost, and has a minimum risk factor when compared with the traditional in vitro and in vivo drug development methodologies. DR is used for difficult to treat, neglected, or incredibly rare diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is categorized as a difficult to treat disease since, no medication is available that can slow down the disease progression without causing severe risk factors. In this context, novel methodologies are vital to find DR candidates for AD. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is garnering popularity due its ability to discover unseen knowledge and complex associations and this study too utilized a NLP approach. The proposed methodology included four main steps. First, the text data that is needed for the study were retrieved, then the information within the unstructured text data were extracted, next, the DR candidates were predicted using a novel hybrid method which included cosine similarity (CS) and link prediction (LP). Finally, the predicted drug candidates were fed into a trained machine learning (ML) model with a specificity of 0.894% and a f1 score of 0.819% and further validated. The analysis showed that some of the candidates which were not approved nor had ongoing clinical trials have enormous potential in treating AD.",

Due to the COVID-19 restrictions that are still active in some countries, the workshop was held as an hybrid event, combining a \"live\" in-person and a \"virtual\" online participation. The online participation was allowed using the Zoom platform. During the course of the day, more than 50 attendees - about 40 in person and 10 in zoom - had the opportunity to follow-up and discuss the recent advances in topics related to representation, extraction, and generation of narratives. The workshop program included two invited keynotes and twelve paper presentations. The proceedings of the workshop are available online at http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3117/",

        "abstract": "In recent years, day surgery has established a strong reputation and popularity. It has a number of advantages over traditional surgery, including a shorter hospital stay, a lower risk of hospital-associated infections, and a higher cost efficiency. However, the patient admission criteria for day surgery were primarily dependent on manual guidelines defined by specialists, which lacked data driving from the real world and potentially wasted a lot of medical resources. In this paper, we proposed a day surgery patient admission algorithm, which is built by semi-supervised learning that combines both structured data and unstructured diagnoses to help surgeons make speedy admission decisions. We test this algorithm with the clinical data of day surgery patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy at West China Hospital and achieve an accuracy of 0.85 and an f1-score of 0.83, as well as reaching 0.97 on the precision score. The result is potentially broadly applicable to more day surgery types.",

        "abstract": "High-level programming models for tensor computations are becoming increasingly popular in many domains such as machine learning and data science. The index notation is one such model that is widely adopted for expressing a wide range of tensor computations algorithmically and also as input to programming systems. In programming systems, sparse tensors can be specified as type annotations, and a compiler can be employed to perform code generation for the specified tensor expressions and sparse formats. Different code generation strategies and optimization decisions can have a significant impact on the performance of the generated code. However, the code generation strategies used by current state-of-the-art tensor compilers can result in redundant computations being present in the output code. In this work, we identify four common types of redundancies that can occur when generating code for compound expressions, and introduce new techniques that can avoid these redundancies. Empirical evaluation on real-world compound kernels, such as Sampled Dense Dense Matrix Multiplication (SDDMM), Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Matricized-Tensor Times Khatri-Rao Product (MTTKRP) shows that our generated code with redundancy elimination can result in performance improvements of 1.1\u00d7 to 25\u00d7 relative to a state-of-the-art Tensor Algebra COmpiler (TACO) and up to 101\u00d7 relative to library approaches such as the SciPy.sparse.",

        "abstract": "Workflows or pipelines provide a means for executing complex data analysis seamlessly. Composing tools into a workflow is essential in bioinformatics experiments. There are scientific workflow systems such as Taverna and Galaxy that facilitate automatic workflow composition. However, designing workflows using workflow systems becomes more complex with the availability of vast numbers of complex, heterogeneous tools. Connecting such heterogeneous tools to a workflow is error-prone and time-consuming. The objective of the study is to develop a suggestive system for interactive workflow composition using frequent patterns in workflows. The approach basically consists of three main phases: pattern mining, component suggestion, and updating the workflow. Frequent patterns of workflows are identified using frequent subgraph mining techniques and N-gram modeling. The suggested components allow reusing best practice workflows while reducing the time required in composing the workflows. Frequent usage patterns identified can also be used in searching similar workflows in workflow repositories. An interactive workflow composition approach is useful for novice as well as experienced scientists in composing workflows with state-of-the-art tools. The approach enhances the reuse of best practice workflows developed by other users. Such systems would succeed more in future with the availability of more and more workflows in the light of open science",

        "abstract": "The high computation cost is one of the key bottlenecks for adopting deep neural networks (DNNs) in different hardware. When client data are sensitive, privacy-preserving DNN evaluation method, such as homomorphic encryptions (HE), shows even more computation cost. Prior works employed weight repetition in quantized neural networks to save the computation of convolutions by memorizing or arithmetic factorization. However, such methods fail to fully exploit the exponential search space from factorizing and reusing computation. We propose Q-gym, a DNN framework consisting of two components. First, we propose a compiler, which leverages equality saturation to generate computation expressions for convolutional layers with a significant reduction in the number of operations. Second, we integrate the computation expressions with various parallelization methods to accelerate DNN inference on different hardware. We also employ the efficient expressions to accelerate DNN inference under HE.",

        "abstract": "Auto-scheduling for tensor programs is a process where a search algorithm automatically explores candidate schedules (program transformations) for a given program on a target hardware platform to improve its performance. However this can be a very time consuming process depending on the complexity of the tensor program and the capacity of the target device, with often many thousands of program variants being explored. To address this, in this paper we introduce the idea of transfer-tuning, a novel approach to identify and reuse auto-schedules between tensor programs. We demonstrate this concept using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), taking sets of auto-schedules from pre-tuned DNNs and using them to reduce the inference time of a new DNN. We compare transfer-tuning against the state-of-the-art Ansor auto-scheduler, defining the maximum possible speedup for a given DNN model as what Ansor achieves using its recommended full tuning time. On a server-class CPU and across 11 widely used DNN models, we observe that transfertuning achieves up to 88.41% (49.13% on average) of this maximum speedup, while Ansor requires 6.5\u00d7 more search time on average to match it. We also evaluate transfer-tuning on a constrained edge CPU and observe that the differences in search time are exacerbated, with Ansor requiring 10.8\u00d7 more time on average to match transfer-tuning's speedup, which further demonstrates its value. Our code is available at https://github.com/gicLAB/transfer-tuning.",

        "abstract": "With the advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), the industry has been moving towards human-directed artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. Recently, chat bots and automated news generation have captured a lot of attention. The goal is to automatically generate readable text from tabular data or web data commonly represented in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format. The problem can then be formulated as Data-to-text (D2T) generation from structured non-linguistic data into human-readable natural language. Despite the significant work done for the English language, no efforts are being directed towards low-resource languages like the Arabic language. This work promotes the development of the first RDF data-to-text (D2T) generation system for the Arabic language while trying to address the low-resource limitation. We develop several models for the Arabic D2T task using transfer learning from large language models (LLM) such as AraBERT, AraGPT2 and mT5. These models include a baseline Bi-LSTM Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model, as well as encoder-decoder transformers like BERT2BERT, BERT2GPT, and T5. We then provide detailed comparative study highlighting the strengths and limitations of these methods setting the stage for further advancement in the field. We also introduce a new Arabic dataset (AraWebNLG) that can be used for new model development in the field. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, general-purpose automated metrics (BLEU and Perplexity scores) are used as well as task-specific human evaluation metrics related to the accuracy of the content selection and fluency of the generated text. The results highlight the importance of pre-training on a large corpus of Arabic data and show that transfer learning from AraBERT gives the best performance. Text-to-text pre-training using mT5 achieves second best performance results even with multilingual weights.",

        "abstract": " User-stories are commonly used to define requirements in agile project management. In Software Product Lines (SPL), a user-story corresponds to a feature description (or part of it), that can be shared by several products. In practice, large SPL include a huge number of user-stories, making variability hard to grasp and handle. In this paper we present an exploratory approach that aims to guide the synthesis of Feature Models that capture and structure the commonalities and the variability expressed in these user-stories. The built Feature Models aim to help the project understanding, maintenance and evolution. Our approach first decomposes the user-stories to extract the roles and the features, using natural language processing techniques. In a second step, we group user-stories having the same topics thanks to a clustering method. This contributes to extract more general features. In a third step, we leverage the use of Formal Concept Analysis to extract logical constraints between the features that guide Feature Model synthesis. We illustrate our approach using a dataset from our industrial partner. ",

        "abstract": "Automated claim checking is the task of determining the veracity of a claim given evidence retrieved from a textual knowledge base of trustworthy facts. While previous work has taken the knowledge base as given and optimized the claim-checking pipeline, we take the opposite approach \u2013 taking the pipeline as given, we explore the choice of the knowledge base. Our first insight is that a claim-checking pipeline can be transferred to a new domain of claims with access to a knowledge base from the new domain. Second, we do not find a \u201duniversally best\u201d knowledge base \u2013 higher domain overlap of a task dataset and a knowledge base tends to produce better label accuracy. Third, combining multiple knowledge bases does not tend to improve performance beyond using the closest-domain knowledge base. Finally, we show that the claim-checking pipeline\u2019s confidence score for selecting evidence can be used to assess whether a knowledge base will perform well for a new set of claims, even in the absence of ground-truth labels.",

        "abstract": "Medical image annotation aims to automatically describe the content of medical images. It helps doctors to understand the content of medical images and make better informed decisions like diagnoses. Existing methods mainly follow the approach for natural images and fail to emphasize the object abnormalities, which is the essence of medical images annotation. In light of this, we propose to transform the medical image annotation to a multi-label classification problem, where object abnormalities are focused directly. However, extant multi-label classification studies rely on arduous feature engineering, or do not solve label correlation issues well in medical images. To solve these problems, we propose a novel deep learning model where a frequent pattern mining component and an adversarial-based denoising autoencoder component are introduced. Extensive experiments are conducted on a real retinal image dataset to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Results indicate that the proposed model significantly outperforms image captioning baselines and multi-label classification baselines.",

        "abstract": "In this paper we consider the problem of defending against increasing data exfiltration threats in the domain of cybersecurity. We review existing work on exfiltration threats and corresponding countermeasures. We consider current problems and challenges that need to be addressed to provide a qualitatively better level of protection against data exfiltration. After considering the magnitude of the data exfiltration threat, we outline the objectives of this paper and the scope of the review. We then provide an extensive discussion of present methods of defending against data exfiltration. We note that current methodologies for defending against data exfiltration do not connect well with domain experts, both as sources of knowledge and as partners in decision-making. However, human interventions continue to be required in cybersecurity. Thus, cybersecurity applications are necessarily socio-technical systems which cannot be safely and efficiently operated without considering relevant human factors issues. We conclude with a call for approaches that can more effectively integrate human expertise into defense against data exfiltration.",

        "abstract": "Progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been dictated by the rule of more: more data, more computing power, more complexity, best exemplified by Deep Learning Transformers. However, training (or fine-tuning) large dense models for specific applications usually requires significant amounts of computing resources. One way to ameliorate this problem is through data engineering (DE) instead of the algorithmic or hardware perspectives. Our focus here is an under-investigated DE technique, with enormous potential in the current scenario \u2013 Instance Selection (IS) (aka, Selective Sampling; Prototype Selection). The IS goal is to reduce the training set size by removing noisy or redundant instances while maintaining or improving the effectiveness (accuracy) of the trained models and reducing the training process cost. We survey classical and recent state-of-the-art IS techniques and provide a scientifically sound comparison of IS methods applied to an essential NLP task - Automatic Text Classification (ATC). IS methods have been normally applied to small tabular datasets and have not been systematically compared in ATC. We consider several neural and non-neural state-of-the-art ATC solutions and many datasets. We answer several research questions based on tradeoffs induced by a tripod (Effectiveness, Efficiency, Training-Set Reduction). Our answers reveal an enormous unfulfilled potential for IS solutions. Specially, we show that in 12 out of 19 datasets, specific IS methods - namely Condensed Nearest Neighbor (CNN), Local Set-based Smoother (LSSm) and Local Set Border Selector (LSBo) \u2013 can reduce the size of the training set without effectiveness losses. Furthermore, in the case of fine-tuning the transformer methods, the IS methods reduce the amount of data needed, without losing effectiveness and with considerable training-time gains.",

Conversational speech is both the most difficult and environmentally relevant sort of data for speech recognition. In this paper, we take a linguistic perspective, and take the French language as a case study toward disambiguation of the French homophones. Our contribution aims to provide more insight into human speech transcription accuracy in conditions to reproduce those of state-of-the-art ASR systems, although in a much focused situation. We investigate a case study involving the most common errors encountered in the automatic transcription of French language.",

Our system can assess a user's daily functioning and mental wellness based on a combination of direct conversation with users and information obtained from smart home devices using psychological rubrics proposed in [1]. We demonstrate that our system can converse with a user in a natural way (through a smartphone or smart speaker) and analyze a user's response semantically and sentimentally. In addition, we show that our system can provide preliminary interventions to help improve the user's wellness. In particular, when abnormal behavior is detected during the conversation or by smart home devices, the system provides psychotherapeutic consolations during the conversation and will check on the occupant's condition by actuating a home robot.",

        "abstract": "In many countries, there are local efforts and incentives to further increase the adoption of greener buildings. This highlights the critical need for buildings to be green and for tools to facilitate their transformation for new and existing building owners. Thus, this work curates a dataset regarding the actions and features implemented by building stakeholders to attain the Green Mark (GM) certification which promotes the adoption of numerous green building technologies. Public data from 3,583 entries over 17 years was extracted and pre-processed. Green features of each certified entry were identified and labeled accordingly using a list of keywords created from the GM certification assessment criteria. We present an overview of the dataset and key insights into the building retrofitting landscape. The dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/record/7198276",

        "abstract": "Despite the significant development of mobile device SoCs, they are still inefficient in computing computation-intensive workloads, such as high-resolution image processing and AR/VR applications. Offloading offers a promising way to leverage cloud or edge servers for acceleration, but existing offloading is limited to specific tasks or specific hardware/software platforms, resulting in significant engineering overhead. To address this problem, we focus on the underlying layer of these applications (i.e., OpenCL) and propose Hyperion, a generic and distributed mobile offloading framework built on OpenCL. To achieve high-performance distributed execution for Hyperion, we first take a deep insight into the OpenCL data structures and design regularity-aware kernel analyzer to analyze the data dependency of work-groups and identify the essential data to offload. Then, context-aware execution time predictor is proposed to estimate the computing time of a given partitioned kernel workload that is highly impacted by many runtime factors. These techniques are integrated into pipeline-enabled and network-adaptive scheduler to make scheduling decisions, which coordinates the kernel partition and workload scheduling to form pipeline processing between data transmission and distributed execution with flexible adaptability to network dynamics. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Hyperion achieves superior performance with an average 3.80\u00d7 speedup compared with the best baseline and flexible adaptation to dynamic network conditions and available computing resources.",

        "abstract": "Researchers worldwide have become increasingly interested in developing computational approaches to handle challenges facing electric vehicles (EVs) in recent years. This paper examines the challenges and future potential of computational approaches for problems such as EV routing, EV charging scheduling, EV charging station (CS) placement, CS sizing, and energy or load management. In addition, a summary of the fundamental mathematical models employed to solve the EV computational problems is presented. We cover recent work on computational solutions for various EV problems utilizing single and coupled mathematical models. Finally, we also examine potential research avenues that researchers could pursue to realize the objective of environment-friendly transportation and smart grids (SGs).",

        "abstract": "Bounded model checking (BMC) is well-known to be undecidable even for simple hybrid systems. Existing work targeted for a wide class of non-linear hybrid systems reduces the BMC problem to the satisfiability problem of an satisfiability modulo theory formula encoding the hybrid system dynamics. Consequently, the satisfiability of the formula is deduced with a \u03b4-decision procedure. However, the encoded formula\u00a0can be complex for large automaton and for deep exploration causing the decision procedure to be inefficient. Additionally, a generalized decision procedure can be inefficient for hybrid systems with simple\u00a0dynamics. In this article, we propose a BMC algorithm built upon the foundation of the counter example guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) technique and targeted for hybrid systems with piecewise affine dynamics, modeled as a hybrid automaton. In particular, our algorithm begins by searching an abstract counterexample in the discrete state-space of the automaton. We check whether a discovered abstract counterexample is spurious or real by a two-tier refinement of the state-space guided by the abstract counterexample. The primary refinement is through symbolic reachability analysis and the following refinement is via a search of a real counterexample by the trajectory splicing method, guided in turn by the outcome of reachability analysis. We show that our algorithm reaps the benefits of the CEGAR technique by directing the exploration in the regions of interest and pruning search space that is irrelevant to the property under consideration. In addition, an optimization by memoizing the computed symbolic states during reachability analysis has been proposed for efficiency. The proposed algorithm is implemented in the tool SAT-Reach, and we compare its performance with dReach, XSpeed, Flow*, SpaceEx, and a pattern database heuristic-guided search algorithm. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various domains of applications and gradually becomes the foundations of the advanced large deep learning (DL) models. However, how to train these models over multiple GPUs efficiently is still challenging due to a large number of parallelism choices. Existing DL systems either rely on manual efforts to make distributed training plans or apply parallelism combinations within a very limited search space. In this approach, we propose Galvatron, a new system framework that incorporates multiple popular parallelism dimensions and automatically finds the most efficient hybrid parallelism strategy. To better explore such a rarely huge search space, we 1) involve a decision tree to make decomposition and pruning based on some reasonable intuitions, and then 2) design a dynamic programming search algorithm to generate the optimal plan. Evaluations on four representative Transformer workloads show that Galvatron could perform automatically distributed training with different GPU memory budgets. Among all evaluated scenarios, Galvatron always achieves superior system throughput compared to previous work with limited parallelism.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem of self-supervised and interpretable data cleaning, which automatically extracts interpretable data repair rules from dirty data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, namely Garf, based on sequence generative adversarial networks (SeqGAN). One key information Garf tries to capture is data repair rules (for example, if the city is \"Dothan\", then the county should be \"Houston\"). Garf employs a SeqGAN consisting of a generator G and a discriminator D that trains G to learn the dependency relationships (e.g., given a city value \"Dothan\" as input, the county can be determined as \"Houston\"). After training, the generator G can be used to generate data repair rules, but may contain both trusted and untrusted rules, especially when learning from dirty data. To mitigate this problem, Garf further updates the learned relationships with another discriminator D' to iteratively improve the quality of both rules and data. Garf takes advantages of both logical and learning-based methods, which allow cleaning dirty data with high interpretability and have no requirements for prior knowledge and training data. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Garf. Garf achieves new state-of-the-art data cleaning result with high accuracy, through learning from dirty datasets without human supervision.",

        "abstract": "Point clouds provide a flexible geometric representation for computer vision research. However, the harsh demands for the number of input points and computer hardware are still significant challenges, which hinder their deployment in real applications. To address these challenges, we design a simple and effective module named cyclic self-attention module (CSAM). Specifically, three attention maps of the same input are obtained by cyclically pairing the feature maps, thus exploring the features sufficiently of the attention space of the original input. CSAM can adequately explore the correlation between points to obtain sufficient feature information despite the multiplicative decrease in inputs. Meanwhile, it can direct the computational power to the more essential features, relieving the burden on the computer hardware. We build a point cloud classification network by simply stacking CSAM called cyclic self-attention network (CSAN). We also propose a novel framework for point cloud semantic segmentation called full cyclic self-attention network (FCSAN). By adaptively fusing the original mapping features and the CSAM extracted features, it can better capture the context information of point clouds. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our methods can achieve competitive performance in classification and segmentation tasks.",

        "abstract": "3D Place and Route (P&R) flows either involve true-3D placement algorithms or use commercial 2D tools to transform a 2D design into a 3D design. Irrespective of the nature of the placers, several placement parameters in these tools affect the quality of the final 3D designs. Different parameter settings work well with different circuits, and it is impossible to manually tune them for a particular circuit. Automated approaches involving reinforcement learning have been shown to adapt and learn the parameter settings and create trained models. However, their effectiveness depends on the input dataset quality. Using a set of 10 netlists and 10-21 handpicked placement parameters in P&R flows involving pseudo-3D or true-3D placement, the dataset quality is analyzed. The datasets are the design metrics obtained through different P&R stages, such as placement optimization, clock tree synthesis, or 3D partitioning and global routing. The training runtime and the quality of the final design metrics are compared. On a pseudo-3D flow, the training takes around 126-290 hours, whereas, on a true-3D placer-based flow, it takes around 305-410 hours. It is observed that the datasets obtained from different stages lead to drastically different final design results. With the RL-based training processes, the quality of results in 3D designs improves by up to 23.7% compared to their corresponding untrained P&R flows.",

        "abstract": "Explaining system-generated recommendations based on user reviews can foster users\u2019 understanding and assessment of the recommended items and the recommender system (RS) as a whole. While up to now explanations have mostly been static, shown in a single presentation unit, some interactive explanatory approaches have emerged in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), making it easier for users to examine system decisions and to explore arguments according to their information needs. However, little is known about how interactive interfaces should be conceptualized and designed to meet the explanatory aims of transparency, effectiveness and trust in RS. Thus, we investigate the potential of interactive, conversational explanations in review-based RS, and propose an explanation approach inspired by dialog models and formal argument structures. In particular, we investigate users\u2019 perception of two different interface types for presenting explanations, a GUI-based dialog consisting of a sequence of explanatory steps, and a chatbot-like natural-language interface.

        "abstract": "Detecting online toxicity has always been a challenge due to its inherent subjectivity. Factors such as the context, geography, socio-political climate, and background of the producers and consumers of the posts play a crucial role in determining if the content can be flagged as toxic. Adoption of automated toxicity detection models in production can thus lead to a sidelining of the various groups they aim to help in the first place. It has piqued researchers\u2019 interest in examining unintended biases and their mitigation. Due to the nascent and multi-faceted nature of the work, complete literature is chaotic in its terminologies, techniques, and findings. In this paper, we put together a systematic study of the limitations and challenges of existing methods for mitigating bias in toxicity detection. ",

For the needs of this study, we have adopted a well-known literature review method that enables a concept-centric analysis of the accumulated knowledge in the field under consideration, and accordingly proposed a conceptual framework that facilitates such an analysis. Through a detailed consideration of these projects and their pilot case implementations, a series of insights about recent research development and applications in the public sector are extracted and discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to gain such insights from a research projects perspective, which may reveal useful information about the utilization and deployment of these technologies in real-life pilots. The findings of this study are also justified or challenged by referring to recent review articles that investigate the use of emerging technologies in the public sector.",

        "abstract": "Multiple object tracking (MOT) methods based on single object tracking are of great interest because of their ability to balance efficiency and performance on the strength of the localization capability of single-target tracking. However, most of the single object tracking methods only distinguish foreground and background. They are susceptible to the influence of similar interfering objects during localization, while in multiple object tracking scenarios, there are more interfering objects and the influence is more severe. Therefore, we propose a Distractor-Suppressing Graph Attention (DSGA) to learn more discriminative attention by reducing the influence of distractors on learning attention weight features. Furthermore, DSGA is embedded into the basic MOT framework \u201cSiamMOT\u201d formed as DSGA-SiamMOT and applied to multiple object tracking to verify its effectiveness. We conduct experiments on the MOT Challenge benchmark with \"public detection\", and obtain MOTA 66.65%, IDF1 62.2% accuracy on the MOT17 dataset with 14fps.",

        "abstract": "Continuous proliferation of hate speech in different languages on social media has drawn significant attention from researchers in the past decade. Detecting hate speech is indispensable irrespective of the scale of use of language as it inflicts huge harm on society. This work presents a first resource for classifying the severity of hate speech besides classifying offensive and hate speech content. Current researches mostly limit hate speech classification only to its primary categories such as racism, sexism, religious hate, etc. However, hate speech targeted at different protected characteristics also manifests in different forms and intensities. It is important to understand varying severity levels of hate speech so that the most harmful cases of the hate speech may be identified and dealt earlier than the less harmful ones. In this work, we focus on detecting offensive speech, hate speech and multiple levels of hate speech in Urdu language. We investigate three primary target categories of hate speech namely: religion, racism, and national origin. We further divide these hate speech categories into levels based on the severity of hate conveyed. The severity levels are named as symbolization, insult and attribution. A corpus comprising more than 20 thousand tweets against the corresponding hate speech categories and severity levels is collected and annotated. A comprehensive experimentation scheme is applied using traditional as well as deep learning based models to examine their impact on hate speech detection. The highest macro-averaged F-scores yielded for detecting offensive speech and hate speech with respect to ethnicity, national origin and religious affiliation are 86%, 80%, 81% and 72% respectively. This shows that results are very encouraging and would provide a lead towards further investigation is this domain.",

        "abstract": "Extremism is a growing threat worldwide that presents a significant danger to public safety and national security. Social networks provide extremists with spaces to spread their ideas through commentaries or tweets, often in Asian English. In this paper, we propose an intelligent approach that cleans the text\u2019s content, analyzes its sentiment and extracts its features after converting it to digital data for machine learning treatments. We apply sixteen intelligent machine learning classifiers for extremism detection and classification. The proposed artificial intelligence methods for Asian English language data are used to extract the essential features from the text. Our evaluation of the proposed model with an extremism dataset proves its effectiveness compared to the standard classification models based on various performance metrics. The proposed model achieves\u00a0\\(93,6\\% \\) accuracy for extremism detection and\u00a0\\(97,0\\% \\) for extremism classification.",

        "abstract": "Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) is a preferred Machine Translation approach to convert text in a specific language into another by automatically learning translations using a parallel corpus. SMT has been successful in producing quality translations in many foreign languages, but there are only a few works attempted in South Indian languages. The paper discusses on experiments conducted with SMT for Malayalam language and analyzes how the methods defined for SMT in foreign languages affect a Dravidian language, Malayalam. The baseline SMT model does not work for Malayalam due to its unique characteristics like agglutinative nature and morphological richness. Hence, the challenge is to identify where precisely the SMT model has to be modified such that it adapts the challenges of the language peculiarity into the baseline model and give better translations for English to Malayalam translation. The alignments between English and Malayalam sentence pairs, subjected to the training process in SMT, plays a crucial role in producing quality output translation. Therefore, this work focuses on improving the translation model of SMT by refining the alignments between English-Malayalam sentence pairs. The phrase alignment algorithms align the verb and noun phrases in the sentence pairs and develop a new set of alignments for the English-Malayalam sentence pairs. These alignment sets refines the alignments formed from Giza++ produced as a result of EM training algorithm. The improved Phrase Based SMT model trained using these refined alignments resulted in better translation quality, as indicated by the AER and BLUE scores.",

        "abstract": "Social media platforms have made increasing use of irony in recent years. Users can express their ironic thoughts with audio, video, and images attached to text content. When you use irony, you are making fun of a situation or trying to make a point. It can also express frustration or highlight the absurdity of a situation. The use of irony in social media is likely to continue to increase, no matter the reason. By using syntactic information in conjunction with semantic exploration, we show that attention networks can be enhanced. Using learned embedding, unsupervised learning encodes word order into a joint space. By evaluating the entropy of an example class and adding instances, the active learning method uses the shared representation as a query to retrieve semantically similar sentences from a knowledge base. In this way, the algorithm can identify the instance with the maximum uncertainty and extract the most informative example from the training set. An ironic network trained for each labelled record is used to train a classifier (model). The partial training model and the original labelled data generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data. To correctly predict the label of a dataset, a classifier (attention network) updates the pseudo-labels for the remaining datasets. After the experimental evaluation of the 1,021 annotated texts, the proposed model performed better than the baseline models, achieving an F1 score of 0.63 on ironic tasks and 0.59 on non-ironic tasks. We also found that the proposed model generalized well to new instances of datasets.",

        "abstract": "Bottom-up and top-down attention mechanism has led to the revolutionizing of image captioning techniques, which enables object-level attention for multi-step reasoning over all the detected objects. However, when humans describe an image, they often apply their own subjective experience to focus on only a few salient objects that are worthy of mention, rather than all objects in this image. The focused objects are further allocated in linguistic order, yielding the \u201cobject sequence of interest\u201d to compose an enriched description. In this work, we present Bottom-up and Top-down Object inference Networks (BTO-Net), that novelly exploits the object sequence of interest as top-down signals to guide image captioning. Technically, conditioned on the bottom-up signals (all detected objects), a LSTM-based object inference module is first learnt to produce the object sequence of interest, which acts as the top-down prior to mimic the subjective experience of humans. Next, both of the bottom-up and top-down signals are dynamically integrated via attention mechanism for sentence generation. Furthermore, to prevent the cacophony of intermixed cross-modal signals, a contrastive learning-based objective is involved to restrict the interaction between bottom-up and top-down signals, and thus leads to reliable and explainable cross-modal reasoning. Our BTO-Net obtains competitive performances on COCO benchmark, particularly 134.1\\(\\% \\) CIDEr on COCO Karpathy test split. Source code is available at https://github.com/YehLi/BTO-Net.",

        "abstract": "Sentence ordering aims at restoring orders of shuffled sentences in a paragraph. Previous methods usually predict orders in a single direction, i.e., from head to tail. However, unidirectional prediction inevitably causes error accumulation, which restricts performance. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional ordering method, which predicts orders in both head-to-tail and tail-to-head directions at the same time. In our bidirectional ordering method, two directions can interact with each other and help alleviate the error accumulation problem of ordering. Experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively improve performance of previous models.",

        "abstract": "Knowledge tracing, the goal of which is predicting students\u2019 future performance given their past question response sequences to trace their knowledge states, is pivotal for computer-aided education and intelligent tutoring systems. Although many technical efforts have been devoted to modeling students based on their question-response sequences, fine-grained interaction modeling between question-response pairs within each sequence is underexplored. This causes question-response representations less contextualized and further limits student modeling. To address this issue, we first conduct a data analysis and reveal the existence of complex cross effects between different question-response pairs within a sequence. Consequently, we propose MRT-KT, a multi-relational transformer for knowledge tracing, to enable fine-grained interaction modeling between question-response pairs. It introduces a novel relation encoding scheme based on knowledge concepts and student performance. Comprehensive experimental results show that MRT-KT outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge tracing methods on four widely-used datasets, validating the effectiveness of considering fine-grained interaction for knowledge tracing.",

For the proof of concept, we designed a machine learning model to predict the failure with log analysis and observed the cases where the failure-related logs do not exist in the failed VM, but in the server, or in other VMs operating on the same server. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model which analyzes the logs of all the related VMs and the server and predicts the possibility that any of the VMs operating on the server will fail. To reduce the huge size of the logs collected from the server and VMs, we propose a pre-processing and tagging method that can improve the performance of our model. In addition, we designed a machine learning model using CNN with BERT, which has performed SOTA in various fields of NLP, to receive logs as input and calculate failure probabilities for the next 30 minutes. To validate the proposed model, we collected failure-related logs and normal logs from an OpenStack testbed, and the experimental result shows that the proposed model can predict the failure of VMs operating in the server with an F1 score of 0.74.",

        "abstract": "Benefiting from the improvement of positional encoding and the introduction of lexical knowledge, Transformer has achieved superior performance than the prevailing BiLSTM-based models in named entity recognition (NER) task. However, existing Transformer-based models for Chinese NER pay less attention to the information captured by the bottom layers of Transformer and the significance of representation subspace where each head of Transformer is projected. In this paper, we propose Multi-Task Label-Wise Transformer (MTLWT). From a global perspective, we assign entity boundary prediction (EBP) and entity type prediction (ETP) tasks to the first two layers. In this way, we stimulate lower layers to participate more in constructing character representation. Besides, in each multi-head self-attention (MHSA) layer, we provide a specific focus for each individual head, making the head project into a significant subspace. Experiments on four datasets from different domains show that our proposed model achieves comparable performance with other state-of-the-art models. In particular, MTLWT outperforms the other frameworks without external knowledge on all the datasets.",

        "abstract": "Bach's music has been considered as the bible of polyphonic music study and a major corpus of AI research on polyphonic patterns. The application of recurrent neural networks to music generation has been studied for decades, but it suffers from costly training and fails to process long-time samples. Moreover, the recent popularity of GAN-based models and Transformers are also less able to capture local information on a specific task than RNN or CNN due to their large-scale pre-training. This paper proposes a CNN-based WaveNet for generating Bach-style music that demonstrates it can achieve high performance with more concise architecture and faster training process. In the Turing test, this method produces impressive results, which are capable of producing high-quality imitated Bach music on the Bach chorales dataset. The author also introduces a temperature parameter to control the creativity of the music generated by the model. When increasing the value of temperature parameters, the author observed that generated music would gradually deviate from the original style and appear creative short musical melodies and motives.",

        "abstract": "With the growth and globalization of IC design and development, there is an increase in the number of Designers and Design houses. As setting up a fabrication facility may easily cost upwards of $20 billion, costs for advanced nodes may be even greater. IC design houses that cannot produce their chips in-house have no option but to use external foundries that are often in other countries. Establishing trust with these external foundries can be a challenge, and these foundries are assumed to be untrusted. The use of these untrusted foundries in the global semiconductor supply chain has raised concerns about the security of the fabricated ICs targeted for sensitive applications. One of these security threats is the adversarial infestation of fabricated ICs with a Hardware Trojan (HT). An HT can be broadly described as a malicious modification to a circuit to control, modify, disable, or monitor its logic. Conventional VLSI manufacturing tests and verification methods fail to detect HT due to the different and un-modeled nature of these malicious modifications. Current state-of-the-art HT detection methods utilize statistical analysis of various side-channel information collected from ICs, such as power analysis, power supply transient analysis, regional supply current analysis, temperature analysis, wireless transmission power analysis, and delay analysis. To detect HTs, most methods require a Trojan-free reference golden IC. A signature from these golden ICs is extracted and used to detect ICs with HTs. However, access to a golden IC is not always feasible. Thus, a mechanism for HT detection is sought that does not require the golden IC. Machine Learning (ML) approaches have emerged to be extremely useful in helping eliminate the need for a golden IC. Recent works on utilizing ML for HT detection have been shown to be promising in achieving this goal. Thus, in this tutorial, we will explain utilizing ML as a solution to the challenge of HT detection. Additionally, we will describe the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool flow for automating ML-assisted HT detection. Moreover, to further discuss the benefits of ML-assisted HT detection solutions, we will demonstrate a Neural Network (NN)-assisted timing profiling method for HT detection. Finally, we will discuss the shortcomings and open challenges of ML-assisted HT detection methods.",

In this paper, we present OWL Checker, a machine learning system that can identify if a Tweet contains misinformation or not. Owl Checker first cleans the text of a Tweet, and then queries Wikipedia to retrieve articles relevant to the Tweet. Those articles and the Tweet are passed into a machine learning classifier which determines if the Tweet contains misinformation or not. Owl Checker performs on par with other misinformation detection systems, but since it uses Wikipedia as a source of credible information it can generalize to new and emerging topics.",

        "abstract": "The Asian social networking market dominates the world landscape with the highest consumer penetration rate. Businesses and investors often look for winning strategies to attract consumers to increase revenues from sales, advertisements, and other services offered on social media platforms. Social media engagement and online relational cohesion have often been defined within the frameworks of social psychology and personality identification is a possible way in which social psychology can inform, engage, and learn from social media. Personality profiling has many real-world applications, including preference-based recommendation systems, relationship building, and career counseling. This research puts forward a novel kernel-based soft-voting ensemble model for personality detection from natural language, KBSVE-P. The KBSVE-P model is built by firstly evaluating the performance of various Support Vector Machine (SVM) kernels, namely radial basis function (RBF), linear, sigmoidal, and polynomial, to find the best-suited kernel for automatic personality detection in natural language text. Next, an ensemble of SVM kernels is implemented with a variety of voting techniques, such as soft voting, hard voting, and weighted hard voting. The model is evaluated on the publicly available Kaggle_MBTI dataset and a novel South Asian, Indian, low-resource Hindi language \u0935\u093f\u0936\u0947\u0937 \u091a\u0930\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930_MBTI (pronounced as vishesh charitr, meaning personality in Hindi) dataset for detecting a user's personality across four personality traits, namely introvert/extrovert (IE), thinking/feeling (TF), sensing/intuitive (SI), and judging/perceiving (JP). The proposed kernel-based ensemble with soft voting, KBSVE-P, outperforms the existing models on English Kaggle-MBTI dataset with an average F-score of 85.677 and achieves an accuracy of 66.89 for the Hindi \u0935\u093f\u0936\u0947\u0937 \u091a\u0930\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930_MBTI dataset.",

We use latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) in NLP to preprocess the speeches into four main topics. For each topic, we apply persistent homology in TDA. We thus generate persistence diagrams for each speech in each categorization of the four topics. Persistent homology was first used to analyze nursery rhymes text datasets and extract topological features from the data by Xiaojin Zhu in 2013. Along the line of analyzing nursery rhymes text datasets, we advanced the algorithms for nursery rhymes and apply the new approach on the election speech datasets, which was comprehensively collected by UC Santa Barbara. The goal of our poster is two-fold. We show how to use persistent homology to analyze text datasets. We demonstrate out results by applying LDA and TDA techniques implemented in R to capture significant features, including patterns and themes in presidential election speeches during 2000-2020. We will also discuss potential future directions and implications for our work.",

        "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) refers to automatic computa- tional processing of human language, including both algorithms that take human-produced text as input and algorithms that pro- duce natural-looking text as outputs. There is a widespread and growing usage of NLP approaches to optimize many aspects of the development process of software systems. In particular, since natural language artifacts are used and reused during the software development lifecycle, the availability of natural language-based approaches and tools enabled the envisioning of methods for im- proving efficiency in software engineers, processes, and products. The research community has been discussing these approaches in the 1st edition of the Natural Language-Based Software Engineer- ing Workshop (NLBSE), collocated with ICSE (the International Conference on Software Engineering) in 2022. This event brought together researchers and industrial practitioners from NLP and the software engineering community to share experiences, pro- vide directions for future research, and encourage the usage of NLP techniques and tools for addressing software engineering- speci c challenges. In this paper, we present a summary of the 1st edition of the workshop, which comprised ve full papers, four short/position papers, ve tool competition/demonstration pa- pers, one keynote (\\Deep Learning & Software Engineering: Past, Present and Future\"by Denys Poshyvanyk), followed by extensive discussion among NLBSE participants.

However, their huge number of parameters and training cost make them very limited in practical deployment. To overcome BERT\u2019s lack of computing resources, we propose a BERT compression method by applying decoupled knowledge distillation and representation learning, compressing the large model(teacher) into a lightweight network(student). Decoupled knowledge distillation divides the classical distillation loss into target related knowledge distillation(TRKD) and non-target related knowledge distillation(NRKD). Representation learning pools the Transformer output of each two layers, and the student network learns the intermediate features of the teacher network. It has better results on tasks of Sentiment Classification and Paraphrase Similarity Matching, retaining 98.9% performance of the large model.",

This study uses 15 qualitative expert interviews to identify six realistic application scenarios for artificial intelligence in mental health that reduce mental health professionals' workload and improve treatment. We classify the application scenarios concerning the type of intelligence they embed (mechanical, analytical, emotional) and the type of task they support (automation, decision support, engagement) to assess their implementation readiness and success. Based on this classification, we develop four application scenarios with the potential for immediate implementation and two possible future directions. Our results contribute to the research stream of artificial intelligence in general and in mental health.1",

Many academics turn to regional conferences that focus on improving computing education as a source of best practices and new technical trends. Do the different regions within the USA follow the same trends or does each region have its own specialty? We evaluate the proceedings of the nine regions of the Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges (CCSC) and compare research from 2019--2022 across each region using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) topic modeling. Further we examine the Log-likelihood ratio for each region for detailed keyword analysis. Our results show how topics differ per region and what specialty trends these regions focus on.",

In this paper, we propose a new neural network structure, fused SpanBERT and Dynamic convolutional Attention Network (SDANet), for span-extracted question answering, aiming to better answer questions in a given text. the main contributions and originality of SDANet are as follows: 1) using a pre-trained language model\u2013SpanBERT to obtain a sequential representation of the text. 2) Combining dynamic convolution with a self-attentive mechanism for capturing the local and global structure of the text during text feature interaction, with a residual mechanism to enrich the sequential information. Experimental validation on the Stanford datasets (SQuAD1.1 and SQuAD2.0) was conducted that our model made progress in span-extracted reading comprehension.",

        "abstract": "Cyberbullying refers to bullying and harassment of defenseless or vulnerable people such as children, teenagers, and women through any means of communication (e.g., e-mail, text messages, wall posts, tweets) over any online medium (e.g., social media, blogs, online games, virtual reality environments). The effect of cyberbullying may be severe and irreversible and it has become one of the major problems of cyber-societies in today\u2019s electronic world. Prevention of cyberbullying activities as well as the development of timely response mechanisms, require automated and accurate detection of cyberbullying acts. This study focuses on the problem of cyberbullying detection over Facebook activity content written in Turkish. Through extensive experiments with the various machine and deep learning algorithms, the best estimator for the task is chosen and then employed for both cross-domain evaluation and profiling of cyber-aggressive users. The results obtained with 5-fold cross-validation are evaluated with an average-macro F1 score. These results show that BERT is the best estimator with an average macro F1 of 0.928, and employing it on various datasets collected from different OSN domains produces highly satisfying results. This paper also reports detailed profiling of cyber-aggressive users by providing even more information than what is visible to the naked eye.",

        "abstract": " Public emergencies affect the vital interests of a large number of citizens and are extremely concerned because of their complexity and strong influence. Early warning of public opinion is an important part of reducing secondary harm of public emergencies and ensuring social stability. There are problems of insufficient ability to capture the semantics of trigger words and the identification ambiguity of entity boundaries in event elements in the current study of internet hot events extraction. In this paper, we explore the joint extraction of events using sequence annotation, and construct a joint extracting method based on BERT-CNN-CRF model to obtain the input text fusion full-text semantic information vector by using BERT, and extract local contextual semantic features by convolutional neural network (CNN), and obtain joint extraction results by combining conditional random fields (CRF). After crawling several large public social media platforms with over ten thousand of data and comparing three baseline approaches in the latest event extraction methods, our proposed joint BERT-CNN-CRF extraction model has higher accuracy and better efficiency.",

        "abstract": "A personalized customer approach in marketing offers many benefits to customers and organizations. With chatbots, personalized marketing could reach the next level as they gather, analyze, and use customer data while communicating with them. Based on qualitative data collected with a start-up in the field, this in-depth case study evaluates the potential of chatbots from an industry perspective, identifying significant benefits, challenges, and future directions that organizations can use to engage in chatbots in marketing. Our main results indicate that chatbots offer optimized customer approaches that are less intrusive and provide a better identification and segmentation of customers. We also see that organizations should avoid bombarding customers with advertising messages because the chatbot enables them to approach the customer directly, so use this communication channel wisely. In the future, chatbots can optimize access to a wholesome customer experience that fits customers' preferences.1",

        "abstract": "The unprecedented growth in mobile systems has transformed the way we approach everyday computing. Unfortunately, the emergence of a sophisticated type of malware known as ransomware poses a great threat to consumers of this technology. Traditional research on mobile malware detection has focused on approaches that rely on analyzing bytecode for uncovering malicious apps. However, cybercriminals can bypass such methods by embedding malware directly in native machine code, making traditional methods inadequate. Another challenge that detection solutions face is scalability. The sheer number of malware variants released every year makes it difficult for solutions to efficiently scale their coverage. ",

        "abstract": "There is an urgent need in many critical infrastructure sectors, including the energy sector, for attaining detailed insights into cybersecurity features and compliance with cybersecurity requirements related to their Operational Technology (OT) deployments. Frequent feature changes of OT devices interfere with this need, posing a great risk to customers. One effective way to address this challenge is via a semi-automated cyber-physical security assurance approach, which enables verification and validation of the OT device cybersecurity claims against actual capabilities, both pre- and post-deployment. To realize this approach, this article presents new methodology and algorithms to automatically identify cybersecurity-related claims expressed in natural language form in ICS device documents. We developed an identification process that employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques with the goal of semi-automated vetting of detected claims against their device implementation. We also present our novel NLP components for verifying feature claims against relevant cybersecurity requirements. The verification pipeline includes components such as automated vendor identification, device document curation, feature claim identification utilizing sentiment analysis for conflict resolution, and reporting of features that are claimed to be supported or indicated as unsupported. Our novel matching engine represents the first automated information system available in the cybersecurity domain that directly aids the generation of ICS compliance reports.",

        "abstract": "This article surveys and organizes research works in a new paradigm in natural language processing, which we dub \u201cprompt-based learning.\u201d Unlike traditional supervised learning, which trains a model to take in an input x and predict an output y as P(y|x), prompt-based learning is based on language models that model the probability of text directly. To use these models to perform prediction tasks, the original input x is modified using a template into a textual string prompt x\u2032 that has some unfilled slots, and then the language model is used to probabilistically fill the unfilled information to obtain a final string x\u0302, from which the final output y can be derived. This framework is powerful and attractive for a number of reasons: It allows the language model to be pre-trained on massive amounts of raw text, and by defining a new prompting function the model is able to perform few-shot or even zero-shot learning, adapting to new scenarios with few or no labeled data. In this article, we introduce the basics of this promising paradigm, describe a unified set of mathematical notations that can cover a wide variety of existing work, and organize existing work along several dimensions, e.g.,\u00a0the choice of pre-trained language models, prompts, and tuning strategies. To make the field more accessible to interested beginners, we not only make a systematic review of existing works and a highly structured typology of prompt-based concepts but also release other resources, e.g., a website  NLPedia\u2013Pretrain including constantly updated survey and paperlist.",

        "abstract": "The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has enabled the deployment of various systems based on it. However, many current AI systems are found vulnerable to imperceptible attacks, biased against underrepresented groups, lacking in user privacy protection. These shortcomings degrade user experience and erode people\u2019s trust in all AI systems. In this review, we provide AI practitioners with a comprehensive guide for building trustworthy AI systems. We first introduce the theoretical framework of important aspects of AI trustworthiness, including robustness, generalization, explainability, transparency, reproducibility, fairness, privacy preservation, and accountability. To unify currently available but fragmented approaches toward trustworthy AI, we organize them in a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to system development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items for practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers, engineers, and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges for the future development of trustworthy AI systems, where we identify the need for a paradigm shift toward comprehensively trustworthy AI systems.",

        "abstract": "Emotion ontologies have been developed to capture affect, a concept that encompasses discrete emotions and feelings, especially for research on sentiment analysis, which analyzes a customer's attitude towards a company or a product. However, there have been limited efforts to adapt and employ these ontologies. This research surveys and synthesizes emotion ontology studies to develop a Framework of Emotion Ontologies that can be used to help a user select or design an appropriate emotion ontology to support sentiment analysis and increase the user's understanding of the roles of affect, context, and behavioral information with respect to sentiment. The framework, which is derived from research on emotion ontologies, psychology, and sentiment analysis, classifies emotion ontologies as discrete emotion or one of two hybrid ontologies that are combinations of the discrete, dimensional, or componential process emotion paradigms. To illustrate its usefulness, the framework is applied to the development of an emotion ontology for a sentiment analysis application.",

        "abstract": "The security and privacy of smart home systems, particularly from a home user\u2019s perspective, have been a very active research area in recent years. However, via a meta-review of 52 review papers covering related topics (published between 2000 and 2021), this article shows a lack of a more recent literature review on user perspectives of smart home security and privacy since the 2010s. This identified gap motivated us to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) covering 126 relevant research papers published from 2010 to 2021. Our SLR led to the discovery of a number of important areas where further research is needed; these include holistic methods that consider a more diverse and heterogeneous range of home devices, interactions between multiple home users, complicated data flow between multiple home devices and home users, some less studied demographic factors, and advanced conceptual frameworks. Based on these findings, we recommended key future research directions, e.g., research for a better understanding of security and privacy aspects in different multi-device and multi-user contexts, and a more comprehensive ontology on the security and privacy of the smart home covering varying types of home devices and behaviors of different types of home users.",

The results and assessment refer to the trends in emerging infectious diseases disseminated to those who have the right to know to act. This project aims to detect trends in social media posts on emerging infectious diseases in the Philippines, using the low-resourced languages Filipino and Cebuano, to understand the context of a social media post. Machine learning and natural language processing principles shall be used in the study. The insights from this study's dashboard can assist health professionals, officials, and the public have informed decisions and policies for better public health services for all Filipinos. It is well anticipated that policies based on the dashboard analytics will help prevent the surge or emergence of an outbreak or pandemic and, therefore, decrease the risk of economic loss. Thus, this ongoing research can result in fewer social and economic disruptions.",

        "abstract": "Distributed data-parallel training has been widely adopted for deep neural network (DNN) models. Although current deep learning (DL) frameworks scale well for dense models like image classification models, we find that these DL frameworks have relatively low scalability for sparse models like natural language processing (NLP) models that have highly sparse embedding tables. Most existing works overlook the sparsity of model parameters thus suffering from significant but unnecessary communication overhead. In this paper, we propose EmbRace, an efficient communication framework to accelerate communications of distributed training for sparse models. EmbRace introduces Sparsity-aware Hybrid Communication, which integrates AlltoAll and model parallelism into data-parallel training, so as to reduce the communication overhead of highly sparse parameters. To effectively overlap sparse communication with both backward and forward computation, EmbRace further designs a 2D Communication Scheduling approach which optimizes the model computation procedure, relaxes the dependency of embeddings, and schedules the sparse communications of each embedding row with a priority queue. We have implemented a prototype of EmbRace based on PyTorch and Horovod, and conducted comprehensive evaluations with four representative NLP models. Experimental results show that EmbRace achieves up to 2.41 \u00d7 speedup compared to the state-of-the-art distributed training baselines. ",

        "abstract": " The level of children\u2019s health is one of the problems that the Indonesian government pays attention to, especially in the health sector. Data from the Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey (IDHS) in 2017 showed that the infant mortality rate (IMR) reached 24 deaths out of 1000 live births. Diseases and health problems that cause child mortality such as perinatal problems, infectious disorders, and malnutrition problems are difficult problems to handle at the health care center level in remote areas due to the lack of diagnostic equipment and medicines. Along with the rapid development of technology today, there are many applications that function to simplify the process of managing and finding information, one of which is chatbot technology. Like a pediatrician, later the chatbot will diagnose the disease from a series of questions submitted by the child\u2019s parents. This final project research aims to develop an android-based chatbot application to help identify diseases in children using a back-propagation artificial neural network. The data used in this research is based on the Integrated Management of Sick Toddler (IMCI) chart book. Based on the results obtained in this final project, the best BPNN model for children\u2019s disease problems in a chatbot application with the number of neurons (128, 64), epochs as many as 800, dropout rate 0.5, optimizer Adam, getting training loss values of 0.11, training accuracy of 96%, validation loss of 1.05 and has a validation accuracy of 64%.",

        "abstract": " Transformer has dominated the field of natural language processing because of its strong capability in learning from sequential input data. In recent years, various computing and networking optimizations have been proposed for improving transformer training efficiency. However, transformer inference, as the core of many AI services, has been seldom studied. A key challenge of transformer inference is variable-length input. In order to align these input, existing work has proposed batching schemes by padding zeros, which unfortunately introduces significant computational redundancy. Moreover, existing transformer inference studies are separated from the whole serving system, where both request batching and request scheduling are critical and they have complex interaction. To fill the research gap, we propose TCB, a Transformer inference system with a novel ConcatBatching scheme as well as a jointly designed online scheduling algorithm. ConcatBatching minimizes computational redundancy by concatenating multiple requests, so that batch rows can be aligned with reduced padded zeros. Moreover, we conduct a systemic study by designing an online request scheduling algorithm aware of ConcatBatching. This scheduling algorithm needs no future request information and has provable theoretical guarantee. Experimental results show that TCB can significantly outperform state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": " In the parameter-server-based distributed deep learning system, the workers simultaneously communicate with the parameter server to refine model parameters, easily resulting in severe network contention. To solve this problem, Asynchronous Parallel (ASP) strategy enables each worker to update the parameter independently without synchronization. However, due to the inconsistency of parameters among workers, ASP experiences accuracy loss and slow convergence. In this paper, we propose Hybrid Synchronous Parallelism (HSP), which mitigates the communication contention without excessive degradation of convergence speed. Specifically, the parameter server sequentially pulls gradients from workers to eliminate network congestion and synchronizes all up-to-date parameters after each iteration. Meanwhile, HSP cautiously lets idle workers to compute with out-of-date weights to maximize the utilizations of computing resources. We provide theoretical analysis of convergence efficiency and implement HSP on popular deep learning (DL) framework. The test results show that HSP improves the convergence speedup of three classical deep learning models by up to 67%.",

        "abstract": "Despite the importance and pervasiveness of Wikipedia as one of the largest platforms for open knowledge, surprisingly little is known about how people navigate its content when seeking information. To bridge this gap, we present the first systematic large-scale analysis of how readers browse Wikipedia. Using billions of page requests from Wikipedia\u2019s server logs, we measure how readers reach articles, how they transition between articles, and how these patterns combine into more complex navigation paths. We find that navigation behavior is characterized by highly diverse structures. Although most navigation paths are shallow, comprising a single pageload, there is much variety, and the depth and shape of paths vary systematically with topic, device type, and time of day. We show that Wikipedia navigation paths commonly mesh with external pages as part of a larger online ecosystem, and we describe how naturally occurring navigation paths are distinct from targeted navigation in lab-based settings. Our results further suggest that navigation is abandoned when readers reach low-quality pages. Taken together, these insights contribute to a more systematic understanding of readers\u2019 information needs and allow for improving their experience on Wikipedia and the Web in general.",

        "abstract": " Currently AI has been integrated in our daily life. One of basic example of AI in our daily life is chatbot. The common chatbot that is developed is a rule-based chatbot. Rule-based chatbot have several drawbacks that is easy to predict, repetitive, an unnatural conversation might happened. In addition rule-based chatbot would rely on fixed pair question and answer, developed in a closed domain conversation, and has limited self-learning. Due to this problem, there is a need to develop a chatbot that is able to dynamically response to the question. The chatbot model in this study is based on Simple Dialog and Daily Dialog dataset. The dataset are then merged into single dataset. In this research, we proposed the Seq2seq model architecture with LSTM and GRU cell to create a Generative-Based chatbot. The Seq2seq model consists of two parts, encoder and decoder. The proposed model is evaluated using Cross Entropy Loss and BLEU score. The result shows that the LSTM model has better performance than the GRU model. The LSTM model resulted in 0.7064 training loss, 8.9740 validation loss and 0.0588 BLEU. Meanwhile, the GRU model resulted in 2.1125 training loss, 7.1840 validation loss and 0,0028 BLEU. Compared to GRU, LTSM model have the ability to generate a more acceptable response to the given questions. ",

        "abstract": " Video games are digital entertainment with several design elements that form the basic framework for making them and become one of the influences on player enjoyment. One of the media to assess the influence of their enjoyment is the video game\u2019s review text because it contains customers\u2019 impressions and emotions when playing the game. Kansei engineering is a product design methodology that can connect customer emotions and a product, which in this context is game design elements. Conventional Kansei engineering stages are taking customer surveys, analyzing the survey results, and getting relational rules between products and Kansei. However, the first stage requires time, effort, and money. Emotions from customers can be extracted through their review texts to overcome those problems. In this paper, we propose a method to determine the appropriate Kansei word for each game design element and classify it using three machine learning algorithms: Na\u00efve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. The experiment was conducted using a dataset obtained from a review of a game on Steam. In this study, the SVM model obtained an accuracy above 80% and an average F1-score above 53%.",

        "abstract": " Together with the improvements in state-of-the-art accuracies of various tasks, deep learning models are getting significantly larger. However, it is extremely difficult to implement these large models because limited GPU memory makes it impossible to fit large models into a single GPU or even a GPU server. Besides, it is highly necessary to reduce the training time for large models. Previous methods like Megatron-LM implemented a 1-Dimensional distributed method to use GPUs to speed up the training. However, these methods have a high communication overhead and a low scaling efficiency on large-scale clusters. To solve these problems, we propose Tesseract, highly scalable tensor parallelism with a novel design. It increases efficiency by reducing communication overhead and lowers the memory required for each GPU. By introducing the novel dimension into tensor parallelism, Tesseract greatly increases the memory capacity of tensor parallelism. Concretely, this new dimension furthermore increases the degree of tensor parallelism. Compared to previous 1-D and 2-D methods, Tesseract manages to reduce the communication cost on each layer, resulting in speedups of 1.38x and 1.53x respectively with strong scaling. In weak scaling experiments, Tesseract achieves a maximum of 4.0/1.7 times inference speedup and 3.4/1.7 times throughput improvement compared to 1-D/2-D methods, respectively. By introducing Tesseract, we offer a more efficient and scalable way to implement large deep learning models with limited GPU resources. ",

Usually, enormous tensor program candidates need to be sufficiently explored to find the one with the best performance. This is necessary to make the neural network products meet the high demand of real-world applications such as natural language processing, auto-driving, etc. Auto-schedulers are being developed to avoid the need for human intervention. However, due to the gigantic search space and lack of intelligent search guidance, current auto-schedulers require hours to days of tuning time to find the best-performing tensor program for the entire neural network.

        "abstract": "On-device session-based recommendation systems have been achieving increasing attention on account of the low energy/resource consumption and privacy protection while providing promising recommendation performance. To fit the powerful neural session-based recommendation models in resource-constrained mobile devices, tensor-train decomposition and its variants have been widely applied to reduce memory footprint by decomposing the embedding table into smaller tensors, showing great potential in compressing recommendation models. However, these model compression techniques significantly increase the local inference time due to the complex process of generating index lists and a series of tensor multiplications to form item embeddings. The resultant on-device recommender fails to provide real-time responses and recommendations. To improve the online recommendation efficiency, we propose to learn compositional encoding-based compact item representations. Specifically, each item is represented by a compositional code that consists of several codewords, and we learn embedding vectors to represent each codeword instead of each item. Then the composition of the codeword embedding vectors from different embedding matrices (i.e., codebooks) forms the item embedding. Since the size of codebooks can be extremely small, the recommender model is thus able to fit in resource-constrained devices and save the codebooks for fast local inference. Besides, to prevent the loss of model capacity caused by compression, we propose a bidirectional self-supervised knowledge distillation framework. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that compared with existing methods, the proposed on-device recommender not only achieves an 8x inference speedup with a large compression ratio but also shows superior recommendation performance. The code is released at https://github.com/xiaxin1998/EODRec.",

        "abstract": "Recommender system is one of the most important information services on today\u2019s Internet. Recently, graph neural networks have become the new state-of-the-art approach to recommender systems. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on graph neural network-based recommender systems. We first introduce the background and the history of the development of both recommender systems and graph neural networks. For recommender systems, in general, there are four aspects for categorizing existing works: stage, scenario, objective, and application. For graph neural networks, the existing methods consist of two categories, spectral models and spatial ones. We then discuss the motivation of applying graph neural networks into recommender systems, mainly consisting of the high-order connectivity, the structural property of data, and the enhanced supervision signal. We then systematically analyze the challenges in graph construction, embedding propagation/aggregation, model optimization, and computation efficiency. Afterward and primarily, we provide a comprehensive overview of a multitude of existing works of graph neural network-based recommender systems, following the taxonomy above. Finally, we raise discussions on the open problems and promising future directions in this area. We summarize the representative papers along with their code repositories in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/GNN-Recommender-Systems.",

        "abstract": " Microblogging sites such as Twitter play an important role in dealing with various mass emergencies including natural disasters and pandemics. Over the last several years, the track on Information Retrieval from Microblogs during Disasters (IRMiDis), organized as part of the FIRE conference series, has provided annotated datasets for developing ML/NLP techniques for utilizing microblogs for various practical tasks that would help authorities better deal with disaster situations. In particular, the FIRE 2022 IRMiDis track focused on two important tasks \u2013 (i)\u00a0to detect the vaccine-related stance of tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines, and (ii)\u00a0to detect reporting of COVID-19 symptom in tweets.",

        "abstract": "Question answering is one of the well-studied tasks in the natural language processing(NLP) community, which aims to secure an answer span from a given document and query. Previous attempts decomposed this task into two subtask, i.e., understanding the semantic information of the given document and query, then finding a reasonable textual span within the document as the corresponding answer. However, one of the major drawbacks of the previous works is lack of extracting sufficient semantics that is buried within the input. To alleviate the issue above, in this paper, we propose a global-local attention flow model to take advantage of the semantic features from different aspects and reduce the redundancy of model encoder. Experimental results on the SQUAD dataset shows that our model outperforms the baseline models, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": " Many languages with a wealth of resources have been researched to solve the challenges of emotion and targeted abuse detection, i.e. threat. But when it comes to languages, such as Urdu, it is noted that there is a severe lack of both resources and approaches in terms of Urdu language processing. Therefore, this study concentrated on offering resources for Urdu by organizing a shared task called \u201cEmoThreat: Emotions and Threat detection in Urdu\". The task offered two tasks: (i) multi-label emotion classification (Task A), and (ii) binary threat detection (Task B). Task B was a multi-class problem since it was further subdivided into the identification of threats posed by groups and individuals. This paper provides an overview of the methodology and results obtained by each of the 10 distinct teams who participated in the shared task. In addition, each group presented a detailed error analysis as part of their submission for the best model. The top-performing system in Task A received a macro-F1 score of 0.687. In contrast, subtask 1 of Task B received a score of 0.716 macro-F1 while subtask 2 of Task B obtained a 0.539 macro-F1 score.",

        "abstract": " This study introduces a new normalization layer termed Batch Layer Normalization (BLN) to reduce the problem of internal covariate shift in deep neural network layers. As a combined version of batch and layer normalization, BLN adaptively puts appropriate weight on mini-batch and feature normalization based on the inverse size of mini-batches to normalize the input to a layer during the learning process. It also performs the exact computation with a minor change at inference times, using either mini-batch statistics or population statistics. The decision process to either use statistics of mini-batch or population gives BLN the ability to play a comprehensive role in the hyper-parameter optimization process of models. The key advantage of BLN is the support of the theoretical analysis of being independent of the input data, and its statistical configuration heavily depends on the task performed, the amount of training data, and the size of batches. Test results indicate the application potential of BLN and its faster convergence than batch normalization and layer normalization in both Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks. The code of the experiments is publicly available online.1",

        "abstract": "With the rapid development of modern science and technology and the rapid increase of new scientific and technological knowledge and information, mankind has entered the so-called era of information explosion. In terms of human reading experience, information explosion leads to the change of reading mode, which has brought negative effects and potential crises to human society. The automated essay scoring has great educational and commercial values, and provides a cost-effective and consistent alternative to human marking. The figurative rhetoric is important to the ideological content and artistic quality of the essay. Based on large-scale language text data, various natural language processing technologies have made great progress in the fields of text classification, speech recognition and so on. This paper proposed the experimental methods such as CNN, RNN, Transformer, Fast Text and Bert base to recognize the figurative rhetoric based on the oversea Chinese students' composition corpus. We find that the Bert model has achieved an accuracy of 80.93% in the identification of figurative rhetoric sentences in oversea Chinese student compositions. The experimental methods in this paper are feasible, and can promote the improvement of the automated essay scoring technology.",

        "abstract": " In recent years, the spread of online offensive content has become of great concern, motivating researchers to develop robust systems capable of identifying such content automatically. To carry out a fair evaluation of these systems, several international shared tasks have been organized, providing the community with essential benchmark data and evaluation methods for various languages. Organized since 2019, the HASOC (Hate Speech and Offensive Content Identification) shared task is one of these initiatives. In its fourth iteration, HASOC 2022 included three tasks for English-Hindi codemix, German and Marathi. Tasks 1 and 2 were on conversational hate speech detection. The idea is to detect supporting hate speech, profanity, or other forms of offensiveness depending on the surrounding context of Twitter posts. Task 1 was offered in Hindi-English codemix and German. Task 2 was provided for Hindi-English codemix, and it was focused on further classifying the problematic tweets in conversational hate speech into standalone and contextual hate. This paper presents a brief description of tasks, data, and participation. ",

A total of 95 participants registered for the shared task, 13 teams finally submitted their results for task-A a, and 10 teams submitted their results for task B. The teams explored tasks A and B using traditional machine learning and deep learning models. Most of the benchmark systems have been analyzed by participants capable of handling code-mixed scenarios in Dravidian languages.",

However, these corpora have limited samples and are difficult to meet the needs of machine artificial intelligence. The paper proposes to build a Knowledge-Communication-Oriented spoken corpus for Endangered Languages to enrich the content of corpus research. A Knowledge-Communication-Oriented Spoken Corpus was divided into three sub-corporas, the words sub-corpu, the sentences sub-corpus, and the narrative discourses sub-corpus. This paper mainly introduces the methods of constructing the spoken corpus of endangered languages from the aspects of corpus collection, corpus arrangement and corpus annotation.",

Standard word embedding approaches, such as word2vec, Glove etc. embed each word into a high dimensional dense vector. However, these approaches may not adequately capture the inherent linguistic phenomenon namely that of word compounding. We propose a stochastic word transformation based generalization of the skip-gram algorithm, which seeks to potentially improve the representation of the compositional compound words by leveraging information from the contexts of their constituents. Our experiments show that addressing the compounding effect of a language as a part of the word embedding objective outperforms existing methods of compounding-specific post-transformation based approaches on word semantics prediction and word polarity prediction tasks.

If you use the TOD system, which is a dialogue system for a specific purpose, and the ODD system, which is a system that conducts dialogues without a purpose, you can conduct conversations more naturally. In this paper, the TOD system is used in inducing emotional conversation and providing content according to emotion, and the ODD system is used in the process of emotional conversation. This helps people conduct more natural conversations, and finally helps recommend content through emotional analysis.",

        "abstract": " Posts on Twitter allow users to express ideas and opinions very dynamically. This high volume of data provides relevant clues about the public judgment on a specific product, event, service, etc. While traditional sentiment analysis primarily focuses on classifying the sentiment in general (positive or negative) or at an aspect level (very positive, low negative, and so on) and cannot exploit the intensity information. Recently, the problem of irony detection in social media has been proven to be pervasive among research enthusiasts, posing a challenge to sentiment analysis systems. Moreover, the figurative use of language has received scarce attention from the computational linguistic research point of view. This paper proposes an architecture, the Experts Model, inspired by the standard Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. The key idea here is that each expert learns different sets of features from the feature vector, which helps in better irony detection (Ironic vs. Non-ironic - SemEval-2018 subtask A) and ironic type detection (Verbal irony with vs. without polarity contrast vs. Situational irony vs. Non-irony - SemEval-2018 subtask B) from the tweet. We compared our Experts Model\u2019s results with baseline results along with the top five performers of SemEval-2018 Task-3, Ironic detection. The experimental results show that our proposed approach deals with the ironic detection problem and stands at the top-3 results. We opted for a transfer learning approach by applying our proposed model on three different datasets #ironic, #sarcasm, and #humor, and we achieved a better F1-score. ",

        "abstract": "A new type of number systems (integer coding systems) is used. In the system a set of digits, each of which corresponds to a certain prime number, is used instead of digits corresponding to the powers of a certain integer (for example, ten), All the prime numbers corresponding to different digits are different. Such an encoding of integers corresponds to a discrete signal model, in which the function corresponding to this model takes values in some algebraic ring. The advantage of such an encoding is the independent multiplication of numbers corresponding to different digits, which provides a significant simplification of calculations, including calculation of convolutions of signals presented in a discrete form. It is shown that in this case the convolution operation can be reduced to a situation where the convolution is calculated in Galois fields. In this case, the convolution operations carried out for the signals presented in proposed number system are carried out independently for each digit. A specific algorithm that implements this approach is proposed and its advantages for describing convolutional neural networks are proved. A specific example demonstrating these advantages is considered.",

        "abstract": "Smart on-demand delivery services require accurate indoor localization to enhance the system-human synergy experience of couriers in complex multi-story malls and platform construction. Floor localization is an essential part of indoor positioning, which can provide floor/altitude data support for upper-level 3D indoor navigation services (e.g., delivery route planning) to improve delivery efficiency and optimize order dispatching strategies. We argue that due to label dependence and device dependence, the existing floor localization methods cannot be flexibly deployed on a large scale in numerous multi-story malls across the country, nor can they apply to all couriers/users on the platform. This paper proposes a novel self-evolving and user-transparent floor localization system named TransFloor, based on crowdsourcing delivery data (e.g., order status and sensors data) without additional label investment and specialized equipment constraints. TransFloor consists of an unsupervised barometer-based module--IOD-TKPD and an NLP-inspired Wi-Fi-based module--Wifi2Vec, and Self-Labeling is a perfect bridge between both to completely achieve label-free and device-independent floor positioning. In addition, TransFloor is designed as a lightweight plugin embedded into the platform without refactoring the existing architecture, and it has been deployed nationwide to adaptively launch real-time accurate 3D/floor positioning services for numerous crowdsourcing couriers. We evaluate TransFloor on real-world records from an instant delivery platform (involving 672,282 orders, 7,390 couriers, and 6,206 merchants in 388 malls during two months). It can achieve an average accuracy of 94.61% and demonstrate good robustness to device heterogeneity and adaptive durability, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Crucially, it can effectively improve user satisfaction and reduce overdue delivery by providing accurate floor navigation information in complex multi-story malls. As a case study, the platform reduces erroneous order scheduling by 60% and overdue delivery by 2.7%, and increases delivery efficiency by reducing courier arrival time by 12.27 seconds accounting for 7.29%. We believe that the key ideas of TransFloor can be extended to other crowdsourcing scenarios for the public further.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) models such as convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) are being deployed to solve various computer vision and natural language processing tasks at the edge. It is a challenge to find the right DL architecture that simultaneously meets the accuracy, power and performance budgets of such resource-constrained devices. Hardware-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has recently gained steam by automating the design of efficient DL models for a variety of target hardware platform. However, such algorithms require excessive computational resources. Thousands of GPU days are required to evaluate and explore an architecture search space such as FBNet\u00a0[45]. State-of-the-art approaches propose using surrogate models to predict architecture accuracy and hardware performance to speed up HW-NAS. Existing approaches use independent surrogate models to estimate each objective, resulting in non-optimal Pareto fronts. In this paper, HW-PR-NAS, a novel Pareto rank-preserving surrogate model for edge computing platforms is presented. Our model integrates a new loss function that ranks the architectures according to their Pareto rank, regardless of the actual values of the various objectives. We employ a simple yet effective surrogate model architecture that can be generalized to any standard DL model. We then present an optimized evolutionary algorithm that uses and validates our surrogate model. Our approach has been evaluated on seven edge hardware platforms from various classes, including ASIC, FPGA, GPU and multi-core CPU. The evaluation results show that HW-PR-NAS achieves up to 2.5x speedup compared to state-of-the-art methods while achieving 98% near the actual Pareto front.",

        "abstract": "There is a growing body of research revealing that longitudinal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearable devices can capture daily behavior signals for human behavior modeling, such as depression detection. Most prior studies build and evaluate machine learning models using data collected from a single population. However, to ensure that a behavior model can work for a larger group of users, its generalizability needs to be verified on multiple datasets from different populations. We present the first work evaluating cross-dataset generalizability of longitudinal behavior models, using depression detection as an application. We collect multiple longitudinal passive mobile sensing datasets with over 500 users from two institutes over a two-year span, leading to four institute-year datasets. Using the datasets, we closely re-implement and evaluated nine prior depression detection algorithms. Our experiment reveals the lack of model generalizability of these methods. We also implement eight recently popular domain generalization algorithms from the machine learning community. Our results indicate that these methods also do not generalize well on our datasets, with barely any advantage over the naive baseline of guessing the majority. We then present two new algorithms with better generalizability. Our new algorithm, Reorder, significantly and consistently outperforms existing methods on most cross-dataset generalization setups. However, the overall advantage is incremental and still has great room for improvement. Our analysis reveals that the individual differences (both within and between populations) may play the most important role in the cross-dataset generalization challenge. Finally, we provide an open-source benchmark platform GLOBEM- short for Generalization of Longitudinal BEhavior Modeling - to consolidate all 19 algorithms. GLOBEM can support researchers in using, developing, and evaluating different longitudinal behavior modeling methods. We call for researchers' attention to model generalizability evaluation for future longitudinal human behavior modeling studies.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents iSpyU, a system that shows the feasibility of recognition of natural speech content played on a phone during conference calls (Skype, Zoom, etc) using a fusion of motion sensors such as accelerometer and gyroscope. While microphones require permissions from the user to be accessible by an app developer, the motion sensors are zero-permission sensors, thus accessible by a developer without alerting the user. This allows a malicious app to potentially eavesdrop on sensitive speech content played by the user's phone. In designing the attack, iSpyU tackles a number of technical challenges including: (i) Low sampling rate of motion sensors (500 Hz in comparison to 44 kHz for a microphone). (ii) Lack of availability of large-scale training datasets to train models for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with motion sensors. iSpyU systematically addresses these challenges by a combination of techniques in synthetic training data generation, ASR modeling, and domain adaptation. Extensive measurement studies on modern smartphones show a word level accuracy of 53.3 - 59.9% over a dictionary of 2000-10000 words, and a character level accuracy of 70.0 - 74.8%. We believe such levels of accuracy poses a significant threat when viewed from a privacy perspective.",

        "abstract": "Brain health attracts more recent attention as the population ages. Smartphone-based gait sensing and analysis can help identify the risks of brain diseases in daily life for prevention. Existing gait analysis approaches mainly hand-craft temporal gait features or developing CNN-based feature extractors, but they are either prone to lose some inconspicuous pathological information or are only dedicated to a single brain disease screening. We discover that the relationship between gait segments can be used as a principle and generic indicator to quantify multiple pathological patterns. In this paper, we propose NeuralGait, a pervasive smartphone-cloud system that passively captures and analyzes principle gait segments relationship for brain health assessment. On the smartphone end, inertial gait data are collected while putting the smartphone in the pants pocket. We then craft local temporal-frequent gait domain features and develop a self-attention-based gait segment relationship encoder. Afterward, the domain features and relation features are fed to a scalable RiskNet in the cloud for brain health assessment. We also design a pathological hot update protocol to efficiently add new brain diseases in the RiskNet. NeuralGait is practical as it provides brain health assessment with no burden in daily life. In the experiment, we recruit 988 healthy people and 417 patients with a single or combination of PD, TBI, and stroke, and evaluate the brain health assessment using a set of specifically designed metrics including global accuracy, exact accuracy, sensitivity, and false alarm rate. We also demonstrate the generalization (e.g., analysis of feature effectiveness and model efficiency) and inclusiveness of NeuralGait.",

        "abstract": "Physical therapy (PT) is crucial for patients to restore and maintain mobility, function, and well-being. Many on-site activities and body exercises are performed under the supervision of therapists or clinicians. However, the postures of some exercises at home cannot be performed accurately due to the lack of supervision, quality assessment, and self-correction. Therefore, in this paper, we design a new framework, PhysiQ, that continuously tracks and quantitatively measures people's off-site exercise activity through passive sensory detection. In the framework, we create a novel multi-task spatio-temporal Siamese Neural Network that measures the absolute quality through classification and relative quality based on an individual's PT progress through similarity comparison. PhysiQ digitizes and evaluates exercises in three different metrics: range of motions, stability, and repetition. We collect and annotate 31 participants' motion data with different levels of quality. Evaluation results show that PhysiQ recognizes the nuances in exercises, works with different numbers of repetitions, and achieves an accuracy of 89.67% in detecting levels of exercise quality and an average R-squared correlation of 0.949 in similarity comparison.",

        "abstract": "A user often needs training and guidance while performing several daily life procedures, e.g., cooking, setting up a new appliance, or doing a COVID test. Watch-based human activity recognition (HAR) can track users' actions during these procedures. However, out of the box, state-of-the-art HAR struggles from noisy data and less-expressive actions that are often part of daily life tasks. This paper proposes PrISM-Tracker, a procedure-tracking framework that augments existing HAR models with (1) graph-based procedure representation and (2) a user-interaction module to handle model uncertainty. Specifically, PrISM-Tracker extends a Viterbi algorithm to update state probabilities based on time-series HAR outputs by leveraging the graph representation that embeds time information as prior. Moreover, the model identifies moments or classes of uncertainty and asks the user for guidance to improve tracking accuracy. We tested PrISM-Tracker in two procedures: latte-making in an engineering lab study and wound care for skin cancer patients at a clinic. The results showed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm utilizing transition graphs in tracking steps and the efficacy of using simulated human input to enhance performance. This work is the first step toward human-in-the-loop intelligent systems for guiding users while performing new and complicated procedural tasks.",

        "abstract": "Individuals interacting in organizational settings involving varying levels of formal hierarchy naturally form a complex network of social ties having different tie valences (e.g., positive and negative connections). Social ties critically affect employees\u2019 satisfaction, behaviors, cognition, and outcomes \u2014 yet identifying them solely through survey data is challenging because of the large size of some organizations or the often hidden nature of these ties and their valences. We present a novel deep learning model encompassing NLP and graph neural network techniques that identifies positive and negative ties in a hierarchical network. The proposed model uses human resource attributes as node information and web-logged work conversation data as link information. Our findings suggest that the presence of conversation data improves the tie valence classification by 8.91% compared to employing user attributes alone. This gain came from accurately distinguishing positive ties, particularly for male, non-minority, and older employee groups. We also show a substantial difference in conversation patterns for positive and negative ties with positive ties being associated with more messages exchanged on weekends, and lower use of words related to anger and sadness. These findings have broad implications for facilitating collaboration and managing conflict within organizational and other social networks.",
